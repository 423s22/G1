Medical Transparency

Members: Luke, Philip, Emma, Kathryn, Michael, Mason

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to provide a proof-of-concept web application that scrapes price data from hospital websites regarding procedures and treatments, and list them in a user-friendly and extendable database. The scope of the collected data will be all hospitals and clinics in the near Bozeman area that have chosen to disclose their pricing information. If time and resources allow, we would like to extend that scope to the entirety of Montana.

User Story:
As a (person seeking medical treatment from a hospital), I want to (find the price of said medical procedure/medication at any hospital in Montana), so I can (make a well-informed financial decision before I move forward).
