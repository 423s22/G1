            We just wanted to let you know that although we
            are providing you with the prices for certain
            procedures from various hospitals, it doesnâ€™t
            cover the whole picture for what the patient
            will pay. We want to give you an overall view
            of the general cost, but encourage you to 
            discuss the full cost with the hospital of
            your choosing. Thanks for being here!
            </p>
