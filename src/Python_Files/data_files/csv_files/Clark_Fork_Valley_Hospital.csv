"Hospital charges can help patients understand potential costs for certain health care services, but they donâ€™t provide a full picture of what patients will pay. The patient's financial liability will depend on the full course of treatment and on the type of insurance coverage. Patients and consumers are encouraged to speak to their providers and health plan to get a full picture of what they will pay. For our patients, we offer financial counseling for those experiencing hardship during any point throughout their care.",Clark_Fork_Valley_Hospital
