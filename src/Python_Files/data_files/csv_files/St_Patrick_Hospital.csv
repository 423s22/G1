"Thank you for your interest in understanding more about hospital charges.

Contained in this file you will find information that complies with the pricing transparency requirements prescribed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).   In those requirements, hospitals must provide several different  types of charging elements.  In general, it is useful to create a distinction between two different types of charges that exist in the healthcare industry.  The first is ""gross charge"" that relates to the established prices that are billed to all patients regardless of insurance coverage.  The second is ""negotiated charge"" that relates to prices insurance  companies have agreed to pay for services.  All patients will receive the same ""gross charge"" for items and services at the hospital, however, ""negotiated charge"" will vary based on agreements that exist with insurance companies.  If a patient is insured, he or she will typically be responsible for a portion of the negotiated charge.   The portion of the charge  that an uninsured or insured patient will pay a hospital for services is referred to as ""out of pocket"" expense.  An insured patient's out of pocket expense will be dependent on the type of coverage the patient has with the insurance company.  Uninsured patients should contact a hospital representative to assist with options for payment.  The CMS hopes information from this file can be utilized by researchers and developers to better understand hospital charges for purposes of enhanced transparency and communication.  Individual patient responsibility can be discussed by contacting hospital or insurance representatives. ",,St_Patrick_Hospital
